## Dataset
- The UJIIndoorLoc dataset contains over 19,000 training instances and 1,111 validation instances, covering WiFi fingerprints across three buildings. This rich dataset provides a complex challenge for indoor localization.



## Methodology
### 1) Deep Dataset Understanding: In-depth analysis of the dataset structure and features.
### 2) Robust Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, categorical encoding, and feature reduction.
##  3) Model Development:
### 3.1) Basic Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier and Regressor for predicting 'UNIQUELOCATION' and geographic coordinates.
### 3.2) Deep Learning Model: Feed-forward neural networks for enhanced accuracy in spatial localization.

## Results
### Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 86.25% on training data and 94.17% on validation data.
#### Deep Learning Model: Maintained accuracy of about 82.17% on validation data, with high precision in predicting geographic coordinates.
